# todo

## crazy ideas

- [ ] what if instead of a popover it's a modal, and on the bottom there are two buttons: "View Video", "Not Interested" (which actually sends "not interested" to YouTube)

## required to get friends using it

- [x] better prompt that includes
  - [x] the title
  - [x] account name
  - [x] video description if possible?
  - [x] account description if possible?
- [x] setup hono server
- [x] get frontend talking to hono/trpc in localhost
- [x] trpc doesnt need to be its own package...
- [x] get env working via wrangler.toml locally
- [x] build summary fetching in server
  - [x] transcript fetching should probably still happen on client to prevent rate limiting
  - [x] log token usage to axiom
- [x] deploy hono to cf
- [x] get frontend talking to hono/trpc in cf
- [x] get popup working
- [x] make summary a POST request
- [ ] use hono rpc https://hono.dev/docs/guides/rpc
- [ ] query refetches for no reason
- [ ] make sure we get title and channel in both main page and side cards
- [ ] also in end cards <div class="ytp-videowall-still-image" style="background-image: url(&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TK8YA331eSA/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEnCNACELwBSFryq4qpAxkIARUAAIhCGAHYAQHiAQoIGBACGAY4AUAB&amp;rs=AOn4CLDNiuLxE4ge2iukNpWgZWXzvfOpwA&quot;);"></div>
- [ ] why does this extension hide channel "all videos"?
- [ ] get cva styles to work / or hardcode each variant
- [ ] add d1 (for auth and summaries)
- [ ] theme picker (device/light/dark) in popup
- [ ] add default / advanced mode (call server vs use own token/model choice) in popup
- [ ] make it work for embeds on other sites as well
- [ ] create welcome page with onboarding
- [ ] add d1 to store summaries
  - [ ] unique on video id + title, or just video id?
  - [ ] send info about cache hits to axiom
  - [ ] how to prevent jerks from sending fake summaries?
- [ ] implement accounts (google oauth)
  - [ ] advanced mode should work without logging in
  - [ ] auth.js or clerk? (i think auth.js 5 runs fine on workers?)
  - [ ] https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/discussions/6021
  - [ ] either implement stripe (see next section) or figure out how to give free unlimited accounts to a few people and gate normal mode for everyone else?
- [ ] better loading/error state for frontend

## required to charge money for it

- [ ] separate section in summary for answering the clickbait question, when the title has it? (1 sentence)
- [ ] implement payments
  - [ ] setup stripe
  - [ ] give free unlimited accounts to a few people who have shown interest (sarah, nestor)
- [ ] rate limiting
  - [ ] https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hono-rate-limiter/cloudflare
- [ ] use cache-control (how long?)
  - [ ] send info about header cache hits (at least for regular mode) to axiom
- [ ] also consider caching to idb in frontend?
  - [ ] send info about idb cache hits (at least for regular mode) to axiom
- [ ] figure out what it should cost (based on collected usage data)
  - [ ] how many tokens per video? what % is cache hits? how much do ppl use it?
  - [ ] talk to people and see if they would pay for it
  - [ ] initial idea: 100 free summaries (not time based), then $1.99/month for unlimited (fair use)
- [ ] use v0 to make a less shit ui
- [ ] try to get real tailwind hmr working

## after initial release

- [ ] good github actions setup (publish extension, deploy server to cf)
- [ ] "This summary wasn't good" button => why => use that to generate new summary + improve prompt
- [ ] Evals / A/B testing for prompt improvements?
