  - [ ] is r2 enough for storing auth data?
  - [ ] auth.js or clerk?

- [ ] good github actions setup (publish extension, deploy server to cf)
- [ ] "This summary wasn't good" button => why => use that to generate new summary + improve prompt
- [ ] Evals / A/B testing for prompt improvements?

please also attempt to find the video title. here is its position in the dom:

#thumbnail has a sibling #details, which has a child #meta, which has a child h3, which has a child a#video-title-link, which has a child #video-title.

maybe we can just look for #video-title more broadly without relying on the exact dom structure outlined above?
